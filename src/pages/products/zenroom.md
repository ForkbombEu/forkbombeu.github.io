Blockchain interoperability is the ability of blockchains to communicate with other blockchains, enabling data exchange and transfers of tokens or assets across different distributed ledger technologies. 

Zenroom is a tiny secure execution environment that integrates in any platform and application, even on a chip or a web page. It can authenticate, authorize access and execute human-readable smart contracts for blockchains, databases and much more.

In Zenroom 3.0, Dyne,org implemented interoperability between Bitcoin, Ethereum, Fabric, Sawtooth, Iota, Planetmint, meaning that a single Zenroom smart contract can perform operations on each of these ledgers, allowing operations as NFT or token transfer along with multilayer and multi-source data notarization.

The capability has been exploited in Dyne.org’s blockchain oracle technology “Zenswarm”
