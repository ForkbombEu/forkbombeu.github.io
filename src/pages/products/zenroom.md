## Ultra-portable and ultra-light
Zenroom is a tiny secure execution environment that integrates in any platform and application, even on a chip or a web page. It can authenticate, authorize access and execute human-readable smart contracts for blockchains, databases and much more.

## Blockchain interop
Blockchain interoperability is the ability of blockchains to communicate with other blockchains, enabling data exchange and transfers of tokens or assets across different distributed ledger technologies. 

In Zenroom 3.0, Dyne,org implemented **interoperability** between **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Fabric, Sawtooth, Iota, Planetmint**, meaning that a single Zenroom smart contract can perform operations on each of these ledgers, allowing operations as NFT or token transfer along with multilayer and multi-source data notarization.

The capability has been exploited in Dyne.orgâ€™s blockchain oracle technology [Zenswarm](https://github.com/dyne/zenswarm).
