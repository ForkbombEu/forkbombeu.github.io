## Blockchain oracles

Blockchains are self-contained networks that can compute and store information coming from external sources but are unable to access information outside the blockchain. Blockchain oracles bridge this gap:

A blockchain oracle is a third-party service that connects smart contracts with the outside world, primarily to feed information in from the world, but also the reverse. 

Blockchain oracles listen to blockchain nodes and are triggered by transactions: in return they deliver information collected from external sources that are fed to a smart contract. 
## Features
In order to overcome these interoperability challenges, Dyne.org developed Zenswarmâ€™s oracles. Along with the core functionalities mentioned above our component offers an array of extra features 
- Blockchain interoperability (with Bitcoin, Ethereum, Fabric, Sawtooth, Iota, Planetmint and more)
- Performs a wide range of cryptographic algorithms and flows
- Has a built-in a W3C-DID Controller and Resolver
- Can run on mobile, IoT and embedded devices 
- Multiple Oracles can perform the same query from different locations, returning a signed output, offering off-chain consensus
- Are programmed in Zencode, making the code very readable and easy to maintain, and the same code can run on any platform supported by Zenroom (Linux, Windows, Mac, iOS, browser).


## Zenswarm dashboard

Zenswarm comes with a [dashboard](https://github.com/dyne/Zenswarm-Dashboard) to monitor the oracles:

Oracles operations are displayed in real-time along with their public keys
